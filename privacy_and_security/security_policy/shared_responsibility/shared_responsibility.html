                            The shared responsibility model for cloud security provides clarity on security expectations for cloud users and cloud service
                            providers. However, an understanding of the expectation is just the first step. Users must take action on these responsibilities by
                            creating policies and procedures for their portion of cloud security. Nila will continue to work hard to keep your data secure—like
                            we always have—and will strive to work towards a secure cloud environment.
