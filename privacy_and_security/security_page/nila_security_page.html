                <p class="text-xl">Network security</p>
                <p class="text-l">Our network security and monitoring techniques are designed to provide multiple layers
                    of protection and defense. We use firewalls to prevent our network from unauthorized access and
                    undesirable traffic. Our systems are segmented into separate networks to protect sensitive data.
                    Systems supporting testing and development activities are hosted in a separate network from systems
                    supporting Zoho's production infrastructure.</p>
                <p class="text-l">We monitor firewall access with a strict, regular schedule. A network engineer reviews
                    all changes made to the firewall everyday. Additionally, these changes are reviewed every three
                    months to update and revise the rules. Our dedicated Network Operations Center team monitors the
                    infrastructure and applications for any discrepancies or suspicious activities. All crucial
                    parameters are continuously monitored using our proprietary tool and notifications are triggered in
                    any instance of abnormal or suspicious activities in our production environment.</p>

            <div class="mb-6">
                <p class="text-xl">Network redundancy</p>
                <p class="text-l">All the components of our platform are redundant. We use a distributed grid
                    architecture to shield our system and services from the effects of possible server failures. If
                    there's a server failure, users can carry on as usual because their data and Zoho services will
                    still be available to them.</p>
                <p class="text-l">We additionally use multiple switches, routers, and security gateways to ensure
                    device-level redundancy. This prevents single-point failures in the internal network.</p>

                    DDoS attacks on our servers. These technologies offer multiple DDoS mitigation capabilities to
                    prevent disruptions caused by bad traffic, while allowing good traffic through. This keeps our
                    websites, applications, and APIs highly available and performing.

                    disabling unused ports and accounts, removing default passwords, etc.). The base Operating System
                    (OS) image has server hardening built into it, and this OS image is provisioned in the servers, to
                    ensure consistency across servers.</p>

            <div class="mb-6">
                <p class="text-xl">Intrusion detection and prevention</p>
                <p class="text-l">Our intrusion detection mechanism takes note of host-based signals on individual
                    devices and network-based signals from monitoring points within our servers. Administrative access,
                    use of privileged commands, and system calls on all servers in our production network are logged.
                    Rules and machine intelligence built on top of this data give security engineers warnings of
                    possible incidents. At the application layer, we have our proprietary WAF which operates on both
                    whitelist and blacklist rules.</p>
                <p class="text-l">At the Internet Service Providers (ISP) level, a multi-layered security approach is
                    implemented with scrubbing, network routing, rate limiting, and filtering to handle attacks from
                    network layer to application layer. This system provides clean traffic, reliable proxy service, and
                    a prompt reporting of attacks, if any.</p>

                    application changes are authorised before implementation into production. Our Software Development
                    Life Cycle (SDLC) mandates adherence to secure coding guidelines, as well as screening of code
                    changes for potential security issues with our code analyser tools, vulnerability scanners, and
                    manual review processes.</p>
                <p class="text-l">Our robust security framework based on OWASP standards, implemented in the application

                <p class="text-l">Our framework distributes and maintains the cloud space for our customers. Each
                    customer's service data is logically separated from other customers' data using a set of secure
                    protocols in the framework. This ensures that no customer's service data becomes accessible to
                    another customer.</p>
                <p class="text-l">The service data is stored on our servers when you use our services. Your data is
                    owned by you, and not by Zoho. We do not share this data with any third-party without your consent.

                <p class="text-l"><strong>In transit:</strong> All customer data transmitted to our servers over public
                    networks is protected using strong encryption protocols. We mandate all connections to our servers
                    use Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.2/1.3) encryption with strong ciphers, for all connections
                    including web access,API access,our mobile apps, and IMAP/POP/SMTP email client access. This ensures
                    a secure connection by allowing the authentication of both parties involved in the connection, and
                    by encrypting data to be transferred. Additionally for email, our services leverages opportunistic
                    TLS by default. TLS encrypts and delivers email securely, mitigating eavesdropping between mail
                    servers where peer services support this protocol.</p>
                <p class="text-l">We have full support for Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) with our encrypted connections,
                    which ensures that even if we were somehow compromised in the future, no previous communication
                    could be decrypted. We have enabled HTTP Strict Transport Security header (HSTS) to all our web
                    connections. This tells all modern browsers to only connect to us over an encrypted connection, even
                    if you type a URL to an insecure page at our site. Additionally, on the web we flag all our
                    authentication cookies as secure.</p>
                <p class="text-l"><strong>At rest:</strong> Sensitive customer data at rest is encrypted using 256-bit
                    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The data that is encrypted at rest varies with the services you
                    opt for. We own and maintain the keys using our in-house Key Management Service (KMS). We provide
                    additional layers of security by encrypting the data encryption keys using master keys. The master
                    keys and data encryption keys are physically separated and stored in different servers with limited
                    access.</p>

                    terminate your Zoho user account, your data will get deleted from the active database during the
                    next clean-up that occurs once every 6 months. The data deleted from the active database will be
                    deleted from backups after 3 months. In case of your unpaid account being inactive for a continuous
                    period of 120 days, we reserve the right to terminate it after giving you prior notice and option to
