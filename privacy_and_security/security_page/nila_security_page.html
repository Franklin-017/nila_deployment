            At our Data Centers, a co location provider takes responsibility of the building, cooling, power, and physical security, while we provide the
            servers and storage. Access to the Data Centers is restricted to a small group of authorized personnel. Any other access is raised as a ticket and
            allowed only after the approval of respective managers. Additional two-factor authentication and biometric authentication are required to enter the
            premises. Access logs, activity records, and camera footage are available in case an incident occurs.

          <p class="description">
            Our network security and monitoring techniques are designed to provide multiple layers of protection and defense. We use firewalls to prevent our
            network from unauthorized access and undesirable traffic. Our systems are segmented into separate networks to protect sensitive data. Systems
            supporting testing and development activities are hosted in a separate network from systems supporting Zoho's production infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            We monitor firewall access with a strict, regular schedule. A network engineer reviews all changes made to the firewall everyday. Additionally,
            these changes are reviewed every three months to update and revise the rules. Our dedicated Network Operations Center team monitors the
            infrastructure and applications for any discrepancies or suspicious activities. All crucial parameters are continuously monitored using our
            proprietary tool and notifications are triggered in any instance of abnormal or suspicious activities in our production environment.

          <p class="subheading">Network redundancy</p>
          <p class="description">
            All the components of our platform are redundant. We use a distributed grid architecture to shield our system and services from the effects of
            possible server failures. If there's a server failure, users can carry on as usual because their data and Zoho services will still be available to
            them.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            We additionally use multiple switches, routers, and security gateways to ensure device-level redundancy. This prevents single-point failures in the
            internal network.

            We use technologies from well-established and trustworthy service providers to prevent DDoS attacks on our servers. These technologies offer
            multiple DDoS mitigation capabilities to prevent disruptions caused by bad traffic, while allowing good traffic through. This keeps our websites,
            applications, and APIs highly available and performing.

          <p class="subheading">Server hardening</p>
          <p class="description">
            All servers provisioned for development and testing activities are hardened (by disabling unused ports and accounts, removing default passwords,
            etc.). The base Operating System (OS) image has server hardening built into it, and this OS image is provisioned in the servers, to ensure
            consistency across servers.

          <p class="subheading">Intrusion detection and prevention</p>
          <p class="description">
            Our intrusion detection mechanism takes note of host-based signals on individual devices and network-based signals from monitoring points within our
            servers. Administrative access, use of privileged commands, and system calls on all servers in our production network are logged. Rules and machine
            intelligence built on top of this data give security engineers warnings of possible incidents. At the application layer, we have our proprietary WAF
            which operates on both whitelist and blacklist rules.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            At the Internet Service Providers (ISP) level, a multi-layered security approach is implemented with scrubbing, network routing, rate limiting, and
            filtering to handle attacks from network layer to application layer. This system provides clean traffic, reliable proxy service, and a prompt
            reporting of attacks, if any.

            Every change and new feature is governed by a change management policy to ensure all application changes are authorised before implementation into
            production. Our Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) mandates adherence to secure coding guidelines, as well as screening of code changes for
            potential security issues with our code analyser tools, vulnerability scanners, and manual review processes.

          <p class="description">
            Our framework distributes and maintains the cloud space for our customers. Each customer's service data is logically separated from other customers'
            data using a set of secure protocols in the framework. This ensures that no customer's service data becomes accessible to another customer.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            The service data is stored on our servers when you use our services. Your data is owned by you, and not by Zoho. We do not share this data with any
            third-party without your consent.

          <p class="description">
            <strong>In transit:</strong> All customer data transmitted to our servers over public networks is protected using strong encryption protocols. We
            mandate all connections to our servers use Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.2/1.3) encryption with strong ciphers, for all connections including web
            access,API access,our mobile apps, and IMAP/POP/SMTP email client access. This ensures a secure connection by allowing the authentication of both
            parties involved in the connection, and by encrypting data to be transferred. Additionally for email, our services leverages opportunistic TLS by
            default. TLS encrypts and delivers email securely, mitigating eavesdropping between mail servers where peer services support this protocol.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            We have full support for Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) with our encrypted connections, which ensures that even if we were somehow compromised in the
            future, no previous communication could be decrypted. We have enabled HTTP Strict Transport Security header (HSTS) to all our web connections. This
            tells all modern browsers to only connect to us over an encrypted connection, even if you type a URL to an insecure page at our site. Additionally,
            on the web we flag all our authentication cookies as secure.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            <strong>At rest:</strong> Sensitive customer data at rest is encrypted using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The data that is encrypted
            at rest varies with the services you opt for. We own and maintain the keys using our in-house Key Management Service (KMS). We provide additional
            layers of security by encrypting the data encryption keys using master keys. The master keys and data encryption keys are physically separated and
            stored in different servers with limited access.

            We hold the data in your account as long as you choose to use Zoho Services. Once you terminate your Zoho user account, your data will get deleted
            from the active database during the next clean-up that occurs once every 6 months. The data deleted from the active database will be deleted from
            backups after 3 months. In case of your unpaid account being inactive for a continuous period of 120 days, we reserve the right to terminate it
            after giving you prior notice and option to back-up your data.

            A verified and authorized vendor carries out the disposal of unusable devices. Until such time, we categorize and store them in a secure location.
            Any information contained inside the devices is formatted before disposal. We degauss failed hard drives and then physically destroy them using a
            shredder. We crypto-erase and shred failed Solid State Devices (SSDs).

          <p class="description">
            Zoho offers single sign-on (SSO) that lets users access multiple services using the same sign-in page and authentication credentials. When you sign
            in to any Zoho service, it happens only through our integrated Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. We also support SAML for single sign-on
            that makes it possible for customers to integrate their company's identity provider like LDAP,ADFS when they login to Zoho services

          <p class="subheading">Backup</p>
          <p class="description">
            We run incremental backups everyday and weekly full backups of our databases using Zoho Admin Console (ZAC) for Zoho's DCs. Backup data in the DC is
            stored in the same location and encrypted using AES-256 bit algorithm. We store them in tar.gz format. All backed up data are retained for a period
            of three months. If a customer requests for data recovery within the retention period, we will restore their data and provide secure access to it.
            The timeline for data restoration depends on the size of the data and the complexity involved.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            To ensure the safety of the backed-up data, we use a redundant array of independent disks (RAID) in the backup servers. All backups are scheduled
            and tracked regularly. In case of a failure, a re-run is initiated and is fixed immediately. The integrity and validation checks of the full backups
            are done automatically by the ZAC tool.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            From your end, we strongly recommend scheduling regular backups of your data by exporting them from the respective Zoho services and storing it
            locally in your infrastructure.

          <p class="description">
            Application data is stored on resilient storage that is replicated across data centers. Data in the primary DC is replicated in the secondary in
            near real time. In case of failure of the primary DC, secondary DC takes over and the operations are carried on smoothly with minimal or no loss of
            time. Both the centers are equipped with multiple ISPs.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            We have power back-up, temperature control systems and fire-prevention systems as physical measures to ensure business continuity. These measures
            help us achieve resilience. In addition to the redundancy of data, we have a business continuity plan for our major operations such as support and
            infrastructure management.
