                        evaluation. You agree that we have the sole authority and discretion to determine the period of time for testing and evaluation of
                        Private Alpha Service. We will be the sole judge of the success of such testing and the decision, if any, to offer the Private Alpha
                        Service as a commercial service. You will be under no obligation to acquire a subscription to use paid version of the Service as a
                        result of your subscription to the Private Alpha Service. We reserve the right to fully or partially discontinue, at anytime and from

                        of the Private Alpha Service for any reason. Your use of the Private Alpha Service is at your sole risk and Zoho shall not be
                        responsible for any damage resulting from your use of the Private Alpha Service, including without limitation, loss of data. Zoho
                        advises you to safeguard important data, to use caution and not to rely in any way on the correct functioning or performance of the
                        Alpha Service.

                        The Service will be made available under subscription plans of various durations. Payments for subscription plans of duration of less
                        than a year can be made only by credit card. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of each subscription period
                        unless you downgrade your paid subscription plan to a free plan or inform us that you do not wish to renew the subscription. At the time
                        of automatic renewal, the subscription fee will be charged to the credit card last used by you. We provide you with the option of
                        changing the details if you would like the payment for the renewal to be made through a different credit card. If you do not wish to
                        renew the subscription, you must inform us at least seven days before the renewal date. If you have not downgraded to a free plan and if
                        you have not informed us that you do not wish to renew the subscription, you will be presumed to have authorized Zoho to charge the

                        created and configured on your behalf by a third party, it is likely that such third party has assumed administrator role for your
                        organization. Make sure that you enter into a suitable agreement with such third party specifying such party’s roles and restrictions as

                        sending an email to <a href="mailto:legal@zohocorp.com">legal@zohocorp.com</a>, provided that the process is acceptable to Zoho. In the

                        providing proof satisfactory to Zoho demonstrating authorization to act on behalf of the organization. You agree not to hold Zoho liable
                        for the consequences of any action taken by Zoho in good faith in this regard.

                    <p class="description">
                        The location of the cloud facility from which you are served depends on the mapping of your region/country to the available cloud
                        facilities at the time of your sign-up. We may migrate your account or require you to migrate your account to a different cloud facility
                        in the event of any updates to the region/country to cloud facility mapping at any point of time. You must not mask your internet
                        protocol (IP) address at the time of sign-up since your region/country is determined based on your IP address. If, at anytime, your
                        actual region/country is found to be different from the region/country in our records, Zoho may take appropriate action such as migrate
                        your account or require you to migrate your account to the cloud facility corresponding to your region/country, or close your account
                        and deny the service to you. If you are served from a cloud facility outside your region/country and a Zoho group entity has an office
                        in your region/country, apart from storing the data in the cloud facility assigned to you, we may store a local copy of the data in your
                        region/country.
